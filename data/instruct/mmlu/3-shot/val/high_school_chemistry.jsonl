(A) PCl4F (B) BF3 (C) CO2 (D) Si(CH3)4 A: A | Q: A solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly? (A) 0.500 mole (B) 1.00 mole (C) 2.00 mole (D) 3.00 mole A: C | Q: A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid? (A) 3.89 (B) 7.78 (C) 5.78 (D) 2.33 A: C | Q: Why do vinegar (a dilute solution of ethanoic acid in water) and vegetable oil (long-chain organic acids esterified with glycerol) not mix to form solutions? (A) The attractive forces in vinegar are much stronger than those in vegetable oil, so the liquids always separate into two phases. (B) Organic compounds rarely dissolve in water. (C) Attractive forces in vinegar are mainly hydrogen bonding, while those in vegetable oil are due to instantaneous dipoles. (D) The unfavorably large endothermic process of \"separating\" the molecules in the two solutes compared with the energy released when the solutes interact makes a solution thermodynamically unfavored.
