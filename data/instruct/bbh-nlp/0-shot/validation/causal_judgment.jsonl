He employed two gardeners who take care of the plants on his 30 flower beds: Alex and Benni. Both can independently decide on their working hours and arrange who cares for which flower beds. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. When Tom meets Alex in the garden shortly afterwards, he instructs him to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. He also explicitly instructs him to tell Benni to only use A X200R. Alex volunteers to buy several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself and to tell Benni about Tom's instruction. After a few weeks, Tom goes for a walk in his garden. He realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before. However, he also realizes that some of his plants have lost their beautiful color and are dried up. That makes Tom very sad and reflective. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. Alex immediately starts apologizing: \"I am sorry! I completely forgot to tell Benni about the rule! I bought and used the chemical A X200R but Benni must have used something else because he did not know about the new rule.\" Benni tells Tom that Alex had not told him that they were only supposed to use A X200R. He explains: \"I have used the fertilizer I previously used; it is called B Y33R!\" Tom remembers that he had filled B Y33R in a green can - long before he had read about the chemicals in his magazine. He had never used it. So Benni must have accidentally, without knowing it, applied the chemical B Y33R, whereas only Alex applied A X200R.

You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decision, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: \"Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes decreased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause fewer people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be less severe. It will greatly increase the town's quality of life.

He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him.
